# 📊 ML Model Comparison & Hyperparameter Tuning

This project demonstrates how to:
- Train multiple ML models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM
- Evaluate models using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score
- Perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV
- Select the best-performing model
